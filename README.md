# ASF-Bot V2

### Discord Bot coded in JavaScript to control your ASF instance.
Control your ASF instance by discord.

### REMEMBER!
This bot is still in development we are still making it more optymalized and have more functions

### Roadmap
✔️Finish the main code of the bot<br>
✔️Add leaderboard system where people can see the leaderboard rank they have on country rank<br>
❌Create something called `RECALL SYSTEM` something that only the community staff can use to stop all bots if there is problem with something big like data leaks or other stuff + Auto update (This thing will be public so everyone can see what is proccesed)<br>
❌All stuff that is based in ASF api<br>
❌RCon commands<br>
❌Make something like instances so if using rcon commands or other stuff to specific bot you just do `/control (Bot name)` and your just doing stuff like `/redeem code` and bot will have name of account so like `Dominik` and his profile pic is your steam profile pic and you can switch with out doing all time `/redeem Dominik (key)`<br><br>
Soon more!
